## 🔧 IN PROGRESS (Current Focus)
- [ ] **TESTING PHASE** - Verify what actually works vs assumptions
  - Status: Built but NOT tested at 375px
  - Need: Verify 48px touch targets
  - Need: Test vertical stacking
- [ ] UX Flow validation
  - Script input flow (newly added)
  - Practice Mode button functionality
  - Three-pane layout on all screen sizes

## 🐛 KNOWN BUGS
- **Script Distribution Testing Needed** ⚠️ Enhanced debugging added but not tested
  - **Status**: Parse & Apply button now functional, ready for testing
  - **Need**: Verify script actually distributes across slides vs dumping on slide 1

## 🐛 FIXED BUGS - September 17 Session
- ~~RTF file parsing nightmare~~ ✅ FIXED (removed RTF support, added conversion guidance)
- ~~Parse & Apply button permanently grayed out~~ ✅ FIXED (React state timing issue)
- ~~Script upload invisible to Setup mode~~ ✅ FIXED (global state bridge)
- ~~Confusing "Preparation" vs "Practice" modes~~ ✅ FIXED (renamed to Setup/Practice)
- ~~Random slide starting positions~~ ✅ FIXED (always start slide 1)
- ~~localStorage quota exceeded~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~PDF.js worker path issues~~ ✅ FIXED (using CDN)
- ~~Script processor syntax error~~ ✅ FIXED  
- ~~Canvas performance warning~~ ✅ FIXED

## 📱 MOBILE REQUIREMENTS (Not Verified)

- [ ] Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- [ ] Upload a 2-3 page PDF
- [ ] Add scripts with keywords ("important", "key", "moving on", "pause")
- [ ] Click Practice Mode button
- [ ] Verify three panes appear
- [ ] Test on mobile (375px)
- [ ] Check console for errors

### 2. Fix Critical Issues (if found)
- [ ] Fix Practice Mode button if broken
- [ ] Verify mobile layout works
- [ ] Fix hide/show pane controls if needed

### 3. Complete Practice Mode (if working)
- [ ] Test auto-extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Polish mobile experience
- [ ] Verify persistence works

### 4. Move to Delivery Mode (next phase)
- [ ] Clean presenter view
- [ ] Teleprompter scrolling
- [ ] Full-screen support
- [ ] Timer and progress

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 💡 Project Lessons Learned

**See LESSONS_LEARNED.md for complete universal patterns.**

### Project-Specific Insights:
1. **localStorage Image Trap** - Never store base64 images in localStorage (5MB limit)
2. **Test Before Assuming** - Practice Mode worked, we just broke persistence
3. **User Flow ≠ Dev Order** - Users write scripts first, not slides first  
4. **Context Degradation** - Long conversations lose focus, restart for new features
5. **Working > Perfect** - Test basic functionality before perfecting architecture

### Universal Applicability:
These patterns apply to **every web app**:
- E-commerce: Product images → IndexedDB
- Social: User uploads → Cloud storage
- Dashboards: Chart data → Proper persistence
- All projects: Test mobile continuously, not at end
