# 📊 PresentationStudio Project Status Dashboard
**Last Updated: Sept 17, 2025 - Post RTF Session**

## 🎯 Project Vision
**Complete Presentation Workflow: 📁 Setup → 🎤 Practice → 🎙️ Delivery**

**Current Focus**: Setup and Practice modes (95% complete)
**Next Phase**: Delivery mode for clean presenter experience

## ✅ COMPLETED (What's Working)
- [x] Project setup (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- [x] PDF upload and conversion to images  
- [x] Slide viewer with navigation (starts at slide 1)
- [x] Script processing: TXT files with RTF artifact cleaning
- [x] Script file upload with global state sharing
- [x] Parse & Apply Script button functionality
- [x] Zustand store with persistence (fixed storage issue)
- [x] Practice Mode components (ScriptPane, GuidePane, ThumbnailPane)
- [x] Script processor with enhanced debugging
- [x] Mode switcher: Clear "📁 Setup" and "🎤 Practice" naming
- [x] Enhanced welcome screen with script-first workflow
- [x] RTF file rejection with conversion instructions

## 🔧 IN PROGRESS (Current Focus)
- [ ] **TESTING PHASE** - Verify what actually works vs assumptions
  - Status: Built but NOT tested at 375px
  - Need: Verify 48px touch targets
  - Need: Test vertical stacking
- [ ] UX Flow validation
  - Script input flow (newly added)
  - Practice Mode button functionality
  - Three-pane layout on all screen sizes

## 🐛 KNOWN BUGS
- **Script Distribution Testing Needed** ⚠️ Enhanced debugging added but not tested
  - **Status**: Parse & Apply button now functional, ready for testing
  - **Need**: Verify script actually distributes across slides vs dumping on slide 1

## 🐛 FIXED BUGS - September 17 Session
- ~~RTF file parsing nightmare~~ ✅ FIXED (removed RTF support, added conversion guidance)
- ~~Parse & Apply button permanently grayed out~~ ✅ FIXED (React state timing issue)
- ~~Script upload invisible to Setup mode~~ ✅ FIXED (global state bridge)
- ~~Confusing "Preparation" vs "Practice" modes~~ ✅ FIXED (renamed to Setup/Practice)
- ~~Random slide starting positions~~ ✅ FIXED (always start slide 1)
- ~~localStorage quota exceeded~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~PDF.js worker path issues~~ ✅ FIXED (using CDN)
- ~~Script processor syntax error~~ ✅ FIXED  
- ~~Canvas performance warning~~ ✅ FIXED

## 📱 MOBILE REQUIREMENTS (Not Verified)

- [ ] Upload a 2-3 page PDF
- [ ] Add scripts with keywords ("important", "key", "moving on", "pause")
- [ ] Click Practice Mode button
- [ ] Verify three panes appear
- [ ] Test on mobile (375px)
- [ ] Check console for errors

### 2. Fix Critical Issues (if found)
- [ ] Fix Practice Mode button if broken
- [ ] Verify mobile layout works
- [ ] Fix hide/show pane controls if needed

### 3. Complete Practice Mode (if working)
- [ ] Test auto-extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Polish mobile experience
- [ ] Verify persistence works

### 4. Move to Delivery Mode (next phase)
- [ ] Clean presenter view
- [ ] Teleprompter scrolling
- [ ] Full-screen support
- [ ] Timer and progress

## 📊 Progress Tracking

  - Script processing functional ✅
  - UX improvements complete ✅
  - Mobile testing ⏳
  - Script distribution testing ⏳
- **Phase 4: Delivery Mode** ⬜ NOT STARTED
- **Phase 5: Advanced Features** ⬜ FUTURE

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Practice Mode
- [ ] Can upload PDF and add scripts
- [ ] Practice Mode shows three panes
- [ ] Keywords are highlighted  
- [ ] Key points auto-extracted
- [ ] Works on iPhone (375px)
- [ ] Can hide/show panes
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Scripts persist on refresh

## 📝 Testing Checklist
**Use this every time you test:**

### Desktop (1024px)
- [ ] Upload PDF works
- [ ] Scripts save
- [ ] Practice Mode loads
- [ ] Three columns display

### Mobile (375px) 
- [ ] Panes stack vertically
- [ ] Buttons are tappable
- [ ] No horizontal scroll
- [ ] Text is readable

### Functionality

## 🚦 Current Status: **READY FOR CORE WORKFLOW TESTING**
**Major Issues Resolved**: RTF processing, button functionality, mode naming, navigation
**Recommendation**: Test the complete workflow: PDF upload → Script upload → Parse & Apply → Practice Mode

## 📌 Key Decisions Needed
- Script-first or Slide-first flow?
- Include PowerPoint now or later?  
- Polish Practice Mode or start Delivery Mode?

## 💡 Project Lessons Learned

**See LESSONS_LEARNED.md for complete universal patterns.**

### Project-Specific Insights:
1. **localStorage Image Trap** - Never store base64 images in localStorage (5MB limit)
2. **Test Before Assuming** - Practice Mode worked, we just broke persistence
3. **User Flow ≠ Dev Order** - Users write scripts first, not slides first  
4. **Context Degradation** - Long conversations lose focus, restart for new features
5. **Working > Perfect** - Test basic functionality before perfecting architecture

### Universal Applicability:
These patterns apply to **every web app**:
- E-commerce: Product images → IndexedDB
- Social: User uploads → Cloud storage
- Dashboards: Chart data → Proper persistence
- All projects: Test mobile continuously, not at end
