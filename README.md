## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### 🚀 **Hybrid Storage Architecture** 
**Revolutionary approach that solves localStorage quota issues while maintaining performance:**

- **🗄️ IndexedDB** (via Dexie): Stores PDF slide images
  - Unlimited storage capacity (hundreds of MB+)
  - Images persist indefinitely across browser sessions
  - Automatic cleanup of old presentations
  - Professional-grade database operations

- **⚡ localStorage**: Stores app state and scripts
  - Fast access for UI state and navigation
  - Small footprint (metadata only)
  - Instant app restoration

- **🔄 Automatic Image Restoration**: React useEffect hooks detect missing images and restore from IndexedDB

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Centralized state with presentation data, upload status, and navigation
- **Hybrid Persistence**: Images in IndexedDB, state in localStorage for optimal performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and graceful recovery mechanisms

### PDF Processing Flow
1. **File Upload**: User drops/selects PDF file via react-dropzone
2. **Validation**: File type and size validation with user feedback
3. **Conversion**: PDF.js processes each page into high-quality PNG images
4. **IndexedDB Storage**: Images automatically saved to IndexedDB via Dexie
5. **State Management**: Presentation metadata stored in Zustand with localStorage persistence
6. **Auto-Restoration**: Images automatically loaded from IndexedDB on app restart

### Component Architecture
- **Feature-based**: Organized by functionality (upload, slides, script)
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components separate from business logic
- **Reusable Components**: Shared components for consistent UI patterns
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Workflow

**📁 Setup Phase** ✅ **Complete & Beautiful:**
- Upload PDF slides via elegant drag-and-drop interface with shadcn/ui components
- Upload TXT script file or paste script content with professional file handling
- Click "Parse & Apply Script" to intelligently distribute content across slides
- Images automatically saved to IndexedDB for unlimited storage

**🎤 Practice Mode** ✅ **Complete & Premium with Advanced Editing:**
- **Superior Three-Section Layout**: Slide + Guide (top row, equal sizes) | Script (bottom row, full width)
- **Perfect Visual Balance**: Slide and Presenter Guide get equal prominence and visual weight
- **Inline Script Editing**: Click-to-edit scripts with auto-save (1-second debounce)
- **Presenter Guide Editing**: Customize transitions and key messages with form-based interface
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Automatic extraction of key points, transitions, and timing cues
- **Smart Script Processing**: Enhanced parsing with slide-count awareness and intelligent distribution
- **Manual Script Mapping**: Drag-and-drop modal for precise script-to-slide mapping
- **Auto-Save Functionality**: Debounced saves prevent data loss during editing
- **Professional UI**: Glass morphism cards with gradient designs and smooth animations

  'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs',
  import.meta.url
).toString();
```

### Vite Configuration
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'), // Path aliases
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['pdfjs-dist'], // Pre-bundle PDF.js
  },
});
```
