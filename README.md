# 🚀 PresentationStudio

🛡️ **AI-Powered Presentation Coaching** with GPT-4o Vision Intelligence, flexible API integration, and production-grade reliability. Built with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui for professional presenters who demand excellence.

🎯 **AI-Enhanced Workflow:** Upload PDF slides → Add your script → AI analyzes slides with Vision → Intelligent script-to-slide matching → Practice with AI guidance → Deliver confidently

## 🆕 RECENT IMPROVEMENTS (Sept 2024)

### ✅ **Mobile UX Overhaul**
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Practice mode was unusable on mobile (overlapping UI)
- **New Mobile Layout**: CSS Grid with fixed heights, no overlaps
- **Touch-Friendly**: 44px+ tap targets, horizontal scroll for slide numbers
- **Responsive Design**: Tab switcher for Script/Guide sections on mobile

### ✅ **Basic Practice Mode**
- **No AI Required**: Practice immediately with just PDF + Script
- **Two Modes**: "Basic Practice" (full script) and "AI-Enhanced Practice" (per-slide)
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Prompts to enhance with AI for better experience

### ✅ **Mobile Scrolling Fix (Sept 20, 2024 - Commit: b2c6f5d)**
- **Issue**: Mobile scrolling was completely broken - users couldn't scroll on welcome/setup screens
- **Root Causes**: 
  - `index.css` had `height: 100%` on html, body, #root overriding fixes
  - Touch event listener for pull-to-refresh prevention was blocking ALL touch moves
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `height: 100%` from index.css
  - Removed `preventPullToRefresh` touch event listener from App.tsx
  - Pull-to-refresh now prevented with CSS only: `overscroll-behavior-y: contain`
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING - Scrolling functional on all mobile devices

### ✅ **Consistent Upload Flows**
- **Script-First**: Script → Slides → Setup (Part 1 Complete)
- **Slides-First**: Slides → Script → Setup (Part 1 Complete)
- **Unified Experience**: Both paths have same steps and UI

### ✅ **Better Messaging**
- **Clear Preparation Options**: Three distinct paths - Quick Start, Manual Setup, AI Setup
- **Dynamic Buttons**: "Process with OpenAI" → "✓ Go to Practice" after completion
- **Success Toasts**: Clear feedback at each step
- **Data Protection**: Confirmation dialog before clearing data

### ✅ **Hybrid Script Alignment** (Partially Implemented)
- **Manual Script Distribution**: Users can manually assign script sections to slides ✅
- **User-Written Guides**: ❌ *Planned but not implemented due to type conflicts*
- **AI Respects Manual Work**: AI processor uses manually distributed scripts if present ✅
- **Visual Status Grid**: See which slides have scripts at a glance ✅

**Note**: The enhanced manual alignment with custom guide creation was removed due to incompatible type definitions between the guide structure needed for manual creation vs. the AI-generated ContentGuide interface.

## 🔐 FLEXIBLE API INTEGRATION

### 🛡️ DUAL-MODE ARCHITECTURE

✅ **Server-side Mode (Default)**: API key stored securely on server  
✅ **Client-side Mode (Optional)**: Bring your own OpenAI key if no server key exists

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API Key (for secure backend deployment)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd presentation-studio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 🔐 **SECURE DEPLOYMENT (Production)**

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never deploy without setting up the secure backend proxy!

#### **1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your OpenAI API key (NEVER commit this!)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-secret-key-here
```

#### **2. Vercel Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel with secure environment
vercel --prod

# In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
# Add: OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-secret-key
```

#### **3. Health Check Verification**
```bash
# Test your deployment
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/ai/read-slide/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","hasApiKey":true,"service":"ai-slide-reader"}
```

#### **4. Security Validation**
✅ **Verify API keys are NOT in browser**: Open DevTools → Application → localStorage (should be empty)  
✅ **Test proxy endpoints**: AI requests go to `/api/ai/read-slide` not `api.openai.com`  
✅ **Rate limiting active**: Multiple rapid requests should be throttled  
✅ **Error handling**: Invalid requests return user-friendly messages

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### 🚀 **Hybrid Storage Architecture** 
**Revolutionary approach that solves localStorage quota issues while maintaining performance:**

- **🗄️ IndexedDB** (via Dexie): Stores PDF slide images
  - Unlimited storage capacity (hundreds of MB+)
  - Images persist indefinitely across browser sessions
  - Automatic cleanup of old presentations
  - Professional-grade database operations

- **⚡ localStorage**: Stores app state and scripts
  - Fast access for UI state and navigation
  - Small footprint (metadata only)
  - Instant app restoration

- **🔄 Automatic Image Restoration**: React useEffect hooks detect missing images and restore from IndexedDB

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Centralized state with presentation data, upload status, and navigation
- **Hybrid Persistence**: Images in IndexedDB, state in localStorage for optimal performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and graceful recovery mechanisms

### PDF Processing Flow
1. **File Upload**: User drops/selects PDF file via react-dropzone
2. **Validation**: File type and size validation with user feedback
3. **Conversion**: PDF.js processes each page into high-quality PNG images
4. **IndexedDB Storage**: Images automatically saved to IndexedDB via Dexie
5. **State Management**: Presentation metadata stored in Zustand with localStorage persistence
6. **Auto-Restoration**: Images automatically loaded from IndexedDB on app restart

### Component Architecture
- **Feature-based**: Organized by functionality (upload, slides, script)
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components separate from business logic
- **Reusable Components**: Shared components for consistent UI patterns
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Features That Were Planned But Not Implemented
1. **User-Written Presenter Guides**: The EnhancedManualAlignment component was removed due to type conflicts between manual guide creation and AI-generated ContentGuide interfaces
2. **Full PreparationOptions Integration**: While the component exists, it uses the basic ManualScriptAlignment instead of the enhanced version
3. **Custom Guide Fields**: The planned ability to add custom key points, tips, transitions, and timing for each slide manually

### Current Workarounds
- Manual script distribution works, but without custom guide creation
- Presenter guides are only available through AI processing
- The three-path preparation UI (Quick/Manual/AI) is functional but limited in the manual path

### Known Limitations
- **AI Script Matching**: The AI may not match scripts to all slides if it can't find relevant content. This is by design to ensure quality matches, but can leave some slides without scripts (showing "No script available for this slide")
- **Workaround**: Use manual script distribution for complete control over script assignment

### TODO - Critical Bugs
1. ~~**"Go to Practice" button after AI processing doesn't work**~~ ✅ FIXED - Added navigation prop and fixed TypeScript errors
2. **AI Script Matching Missing Slides** - Sometimes AI doesn't match scripts to all slides (e.g., slide 2 in the example)
3. **Complete conversion of console.log to debug utility** - Many console.log statements remain in SimpleOpenAIProcessor
